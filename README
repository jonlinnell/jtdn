jtdn
A very very alpha and very very basic Twitter monitor
====================

#
# DESCRIPTION
#

jtdn uses the Twitter API to live capture tweets that match certain keywords. It can dump these tweets into an SQLite database, print them to STDOUT or both.

The 't' stands for Twitter, but the other letters are a mystery.

#
# USAGE
#

jtdn doesn't really do much right now, so the options aren't exactly extensive...

jtdn [--config path] --db path --keywords keywords [--monitor]


--config	Use this to specify a different authentication file.

			Authentication files should return a Perl hash containing Twitter API keys and tokens. You need to get these yourself.

			The file should look like this:

				return
				{
					token => "<FILL THIS IN>",
					token_secret => "<FILL THIS IN>",
					consumer_key => "<FILL THIS IN>",
					consumer_secret => "<FILL THIS IN>"
				};

--db 		Specifies the SQLite database.

			If the database file doesn't exist, it will be created and the table initialised.

			If the database does exist, all Tweets will be appended to the end.

--keywords	A list of keywords to filter.

			Can be one word, or a list in quote marks.

--monitor	Outputs all matching Tweets to STDOUT.
